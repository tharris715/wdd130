            <h2 class="h2-rivers">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
            <div class="river1-para">
                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
                Salmon river. The Salmon was nicknamed the River of No Return by
                the residents because of those who came to visit and never left
                after falling in love with the beauty of the river.</p>
                <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river. You may also see 
                bear and bighorn sheep. The river corridor is lined
                with awe inspiring ponderosa pines which tower over the sandy
                beaches of the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when
                needed.</p>
                <p>The rapids range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                undammed rivers in the United States, meaning the
                water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower,
                slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                summer, however families with children who like to swim tend to prefer the
                slower and warmer late summer water.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-rivers">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
            <div class="river2-para">
            <p>Winding through desolate canyons in central Utah, the Green river flows towards the mighty
                Colorado river. Towering grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
                scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile
                trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside
                Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting
                geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human
                activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>
            <p>Desolation is rated Class II/III and the trip usually takes 6 days.
                Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National
                Landmark. This designation is based on the unique features and
                rich history of the canyon.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-rivers">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
            <div class="river3-para">
                <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and 
                river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
                breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
                experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
                whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient Native
                American ruins accessible only by river.</p>
                <p>CLASS I-X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale.
                The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I-X (1-10) to
                accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                However, most people are familiar with the regular I-V river rating
                scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
