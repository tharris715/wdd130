    <h2>Timothy Harris</h2>
    <h2>Tim</h2>
    <p>I am currently a research assistant at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston Texas. 
        I moved here with my wife and son about 18 months ago and so far, we love it here. 
        Both my wife and I grew up in San Diego, but we met at BYU. 
        I studied genetics there and she studied biology, which is why we both work in research labs now.

    <p>One reason I am learning computer programming and web development is because it can give me new skills that are beneficial to research.
        Another reason is that I love learning and I want to learn new skills that could lead to better career options down the road.
    </p>
    <p>In my free time I like to read or listen to audiobooks. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson,
        and I'm currently working my way through a reread of all his major books/series.
        I also enjoy trying new recipes and eating said recipes. But most of my time goes to my son, 
        who loves all the parks available in Houston.
