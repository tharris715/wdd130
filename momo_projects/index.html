            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p> Momo has enjoyed cross-stitching for over 10 years. She learned to crochet in her 
            youth, but started expanding her skills over the past few years. Crochet is 
            a good way to relax at the end of a long day of working in a research lab 
            and raising a 2 year old.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This website will show off the crochet and cross-stitch projects created by 
            Momo Harris. Here you can get an idea of the kinds of projects that can be 
            created and see my level of skill. Please enjoy these projects as they 
            have brought joy to me those I have gifted them to. Feel free to contact 
            me about any questions that may arise as you browse my collection.</p>
            <p> Almost all of these projects were made using patterns found online. 
            To access the pattern, click the image of my version to be directed to 
            the website the pattern originated from. Some projects were modified 
            from the original patterns.</p>
