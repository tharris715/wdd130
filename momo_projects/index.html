                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p> I learned to crochet and cross stitch in my youth, however over 
                    the past 5 years I have ventured into more extensive projects.
                    The earliest of the projects you will see here is the Pok√©mon 
                    cross-stitch. This project began while I was in college and recently 
                    after getting married, intended to eventually go in the room of our 
                    first child (goal accomplished!). The crochet projects started after 
                    that cross-stitch was done and I needed another creative outlet.
                    My friend helped me learn how to follow patterns and since then 
                    I have been making project after project. Now, my crochet and 
                    ongoing cross-sttich projects are a good way to relax at the end of 
                    a long day of working in a research lab and raising a toddler.</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This website will show off the crochet and cross-stitch projects that 
                I have created. Here you can get an idea of the kinds of projects that can be 
                created and see my level of skill. Feel free to contact 
                me with any questions that may arise as you browse my collection. 
                You can find me on Facebook by clicking the Facebook logo at the bottom of the page.</p>
                <p> Almost all of these projects were made using patterns found online. 
                The links at the bottom of the pages displaying my projects can direct you 
                to the websites where I found the patterns that are freely available online. Some projects 
                were modified from the original patterns, so they may not look exactly like mine, and some 
                of these projects I made custom, so there are no patterns that can be provided.</p>
