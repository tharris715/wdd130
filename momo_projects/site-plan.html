        Background
        Momo has enjoyed cross-stitching for XX years. She learned to crochet in her 
        youth, but started expanding her skills over the past few years. Crochet is 
        a good way to relax at the end of a long day of working in a research lab 
        and raising a 2 year old.

        Purpose/Introduction
        This website will show off the crochet and cross-stitch projects created by 
        Momo Harris. Here you can get an idea of the kinds of projects that can be 
        created and see my level of skill. Please enjoy these projects as they 
        have brought joy to me those I have gifted them to. Feel free to contact 
        me about any questions that may arise as you browse my collection.

        Almost all of these projects were made using patterns found online. 
        To access the pattern, click the image of my version to be directed to 
        the website the pattern originated from. Some projects were modified 
        from the original patterns.

      <h3>Easy Projects</h3>
      <p>
        On this page you will see some of the patterns that will be easier for 
        beginners. Some of these projects can be completed in a couple of hours but 
        the product is still cute. If you want to make something today, you 
        could try the ice cream cone rattle or the small mice. I made many of 
        the ice cream cones for friends' baby showers and they always went over well. 
        My work involves research with mice, hence my interest in making mice, 
        and coworkers and friends would ask for them as well.

        Techniques
        These projects use more basic stitches. These would be better choices for those
        newer to crochet. However they can still pose a challenge, especially with 
        the smaller pieces, which need small and tight stitches, which can make it 
        tricky to move the hook through the stitches without breaking the yarn. 
        You should test the tensile strength of the yarn so you know if you can pull 
        on it hard enough to make the small stitches.
        
        Stitches and techniques used for these projects include the single crochet stitch, the most basic stitch in crochet.
        The half double crochet stitch which is slightly taller than the single crochet stitch. 
        As well as the the double crochet stitch and treble crochet stitch which are both taller still.

      <h3>Challenging Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Overview
        Displayed here are the more difficult pieces of work. These take longer 
        to make or take a little more skill that the projects on the easy page. 
        The projects that take the most time by far are the cross-stitch pieces. 
        The Pokemon cross-stitch was the most ambitious project I have taken on. 
        This represents about 3 years of working on it after college classes or work. 
        It was finished around the same time my son was born and now hangs in his room.
        
        Techniques
        Some of the patterns in these projects may be a bit more difficult, 
        including the phoenix and dragon. These took more effort than many of
        the other projects, because of the detail involved. These projects will take 
        longer, and so you should plan ahead if you wish to make them. 

        Stitches and techniques used for these projects includeThe shell stitch which 
        uses a series of double crochets into the same stitch to create a shell-like pattern. 
        The popcorn stitch which involves making a cluster of stitches in the same stitch to 
        create a raised texture. However, these projects also use many of the easier stitches as 
        well, it's just a matter of how you use stitches that make a project look more complicated.
